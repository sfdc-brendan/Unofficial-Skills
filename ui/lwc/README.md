## How They Work Together

```
sf-lwc-design (SLDS 2 Foundation)
├── sf-lwc-styling (maps hooks to utility classes)
├── sf-lwc-theming (extends hooks with brand tokens)
├── sf-lwc-ux (UX patterns consume design tokens)
│   ├── sf-lwc-content (words inside the UX patterns)
│   └── sf-lwc-motion (animation for state changes)
├── sf-lwc-page-composition (App Builder layouts)
├── sf-lwc-experience (Experience Cloud theming)
├── sf-lwc-mobile (mobile viewport + touch)
├── sf-lwc-dataviz (data visualization components)
└── sf-lwc-review (audits all of the above)
```

**sf-lwc-design** is the foundation — every other skill references it. **sf-lwc-review** is the enforcement layer that scores components against all skills.

## Installation

### One-Line Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfdc-brendan/Unofficial-Skills/main/ui/lwc/install.sh | bash
```

Downloads all 11 skills directly from GitHub and installs them. Auto-detects Cursor (`~/.cursor/skills/`), Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills/`), and Windsurf (`~/.windsurf/skills/`). No git clone required.

### Install From Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfdc-brendan/Unofficial-Skills.git
cd Unofficial-Skills/ui/lwc
bash install.sh
```

When run from a local clone, the installer copies files directly instead of downloading.

### Manual Install

Copy each skill directory to your IDE's skills folder:

```bash
# Cursor
cp -R sf-lwc-* ~/.cursor/skills/

# Claude Code
cp -R sf-lwc-* ~/.claude/skills/

# Windsurf
cp -R sf-lwc-* ~/.windsurf/skills/
```

### Project-Level Install

To make skills available to anyone who clones your repository:

```bash
cp -R sf-lwc-* /path/to/your/project/.cursor/skills/
```

## What Each Skill Covers

### sf-lwc-design
SLDS 2 global styling hooks reference (colors, typography, spacing, sizing, shadows, radii). Theme-safe styling patterns (light mode default, dark mode opt-in). SLDS 1 to SLDS 2 migration table. Component structure patterns.

### sf-lwc-ux

### sf-lwc-motion
Entry/exit animations (fade, slide, scale). Staggered list reveals. State transitions (expand/collapse, tabs, toggles). Loading sequences (pulse, shimmer). Timing and easing reference. Mandatory `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

### sf-lwc-content
Error message structure (what/why/what to do). Empty state copy templates. Button label conventions (verb-first). Help text patterns. Confirmation dialog copy. Toast message formatting. Internationalization-ready string patterns.

### sf-lwc-experience
Experience Cloud vs internal Lightning differences. DXP theme token consumption with SLDS fallbacks. Guest user authentication-aware components. Community navigation patterns. Experience Builder meta.xml targets. SEO and performance for external sites.

## Updating

Re-run the one-liner to update all skills to the latest version:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfdc-brendan/Unofficial-Skills/main/ui/lwc/install.sh | bash
```

The installer overwrites existing skill files with the latest versions from GitHub.

---

## Requirements

- **Cursor** (latest version)
- **Salesforce org** with LWC support (API 45.0+)
- **SLDS 2** recommended (API 62.0+, Spring '25+) for full styling hook support
- **Salesforce Cosmos theme** (optional, for dark mode if requested)
- **Experience Cloud** license for sf-lwc-experience skill

No external dependencies. No Node.js, no Tailwind build step, no static resources.

---

## Compatibility

These skills complement the [sf-skills](https://github.com/Jaganpro/sf-skills) collection by Jag Valaiyapathy. They focus exclusively on the visual/UX layer while `sf-lwc` handles JavaScript logic, wire service, Apex integration, and Jest testing.
