## Suggested Usage

Ask naturally, for example:

- "Design a scheduling and dispatch model for multi-region field teams."
- "Create a work order and service appointment lifecycle for break/fix operations."
- "Plan a mobile technician flow with offline-safe completion and signature capture."
- "Design parts logistics for van stock, transfers, and replenishment."
- "Review this Field Service setup for operational and scalability risk."

## Notes

- Most skills are planning altitude (frameworks, no code) and pair well with `sf-apex`, `sf-lwc`, `sf-flow`, and `sf-deploy` for implementation.
- Use `sf-field-review` as a quality gate before deployment to production.
