# Service Cloud Development Skills for Agentic Coding Tools

A suite of 18 Agent Skills focused on Service Cloud implementation patterns, case operations, omni-channel routing, digital engagement, feature configuration APIs/CLIs, voice transcript integration, AI-assisted intake, and support operations quality.

Compatible with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and any AI coding agent with a skills directory.

## Quick Install

Copy and paste into your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfdc-brendan/Unofficial-Skills/main/service-cloud/core/install.sh | bash
```

Or with `wget`:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfdc-brendan/Unofficial-Skills/main/service-cloud/core/install.sh | bash
```

The unified installer auto-detects your IDE and installs all `sf-service-*` skills.

## Skills Included

- `sf-service-case-management`: Case lifecycle design, status flow, ownership models, escalation controls.
- `sf-service-console-productivity`: Service Console page patterns, utility bar, macros, quick text, split view.
- `sf-service-omnichannel-routing`: Presence, routing configs, capacity models, queue and skill-based routing.
- `sf-service-knowledge`: Knowledge article model, channel strategy, search relevance, deflection flow.
- `sf-service-entitlements`: Entitlements, milestones, SLA design, violation handling, business hours strategy.
- `sf-service-voice-digital`: Voice/chat/messaging channel patterns and agent workflow harmonization.
- `sf-service-messaging-conversation-toolkit`: Messaging API and Conversation Toolkit API design, implementation, and guardrails.
- `sf-service-field-service-handoff`: Service Cloud to Field Service handoff patterns and feedback loops.
- `sf-service-email-to-case`: Email-to-Case threading, auto-response, assignment, and triage hardening.
- `sf-service-incident-management`: Major incident intake, comms rhythm, swarm operations, closure workflow.
- `sf-service-voice-toolkit` *(hybrid — code + planning)*: Real-time transcript integration — Voice Toolkit API subscribe/teardown, ConversationEntry SOQL with sequence water mark, polling fallback, debounce. Quick Start in SKILL.md, full event payloads + edge cases in reference.md.
- `sf-service-models-api` *(hybrid — code + planning)*: Trust Layer GenAI via `aiplatform.ModelsAPI` — Apex service skeleton, JSON-mode prompting, response cleanup, test mock pattern. Quick Start in SKILL.md, full model catalog + retry + embeddings in reference.md.
- `sf-service-ai-intake` *(hybrid — code + planning)*: Live-call AI form-fill — one-shot template bundle query, non-destructive merge JS, dynamic SObject dispatch, visibility rule evaluator. Quick Start in SKILL.md, full data model + prompt construction + dispatch paths in reference.md.
- `sf-service-review`: Review rubric for Service Cloud architecture, data, routing, and adoption risks.
- `sf-service-config-api-cli`: Feature-to-API/CLI planning matrix for translating Service Cloud requirements into metadata deploys, data operations, and ordered `sf` command runbooks.
- `sf-service-data-api-operations`: Data-only implementation patterns for Service Cloud features that are not metadata-deployable.
- `sf-service-self-service-config`: Experience Cloud/self-service metadata packaging and deployment sequencing for support journeys.
- `sf-service-contact-center-config`: Contact center channel configuration planning for Voice, Messaging, CTI, and Embedded Service metadata.

## Suggested Usage

Ask naturally, for example:

- "Design an Omni-Channel routing model for tiered support."
- "Create SLA milestone patterns for premium and standard support plans."
- "Review this Service Cloud setup for operational risk."
- "Plan a case-to-field-service dispatch handoff model."
- "Design a Messaging API + Conversation Toolkit integration for agent handoff."
- "Design a real-time transcript contract for an LWC on the VoiceCall page."
- "Plan a Trust Layer GenAI prompt contract for case classification."
- "Design a configurable AI-assisted intake template for roadside assistance calls."
- "Map these Service Cloud features to exact APIs and `sf` CLI commands for deployment."
- "Split this Service Cloud rollout into metadata deploys versus data API loads."

## Notes

- Most of these skills are planning altitude (frameworks, no code) — pair them with `sf-apex`, `sf-lwc`, `sf-flow`, and `sf-deploy` for execution.
- Three skills are **hybrid altitude** (Quick Start code patterns in SKILL.md + deep reference in reference.md): `sf-service-voice-toolkit`, `sf-service-models-api`, `sf-service-ai-intake`. Use these directly for implementation — they contain copy-paste-ready Apex and LWC patterns proven in [sfdc-brendan/voice-intake-builder](https://github.com/sfdc-brendan/voice-intake-builder).
