## Suggested Usage

Ask naturally, for example:

- "Plan the end-to-end build for an Agentforce Contact Center voice agent."
- "Set up a native Salesforce Voice channel and get my org dial-ready."
- "Connect my Agentforce Service Agent to Telephony and add an escalation flow."
- "Add a DTMF IVR menu with a welcome prompt and route to billing or sales."
- "Upload hold music and map it to a custom media label."
- "Configure callback requests with auto-dial for US numbers."
- "Turn on Work Summaries for Voice and map the summary fields."
- "Set up the supervisor Command Center and fix the Voice Calls report install."
- "My Agentforce Voice escalation never transfers — how do I fix it?"

## Notes

- These skills are primarily **planning/runbook altitude** (Setup click-paths and configuration sequences), matching how native Voice is configured in the UI. Pair them with `sf-flow` (Omni-Channel flows), `sf-ai-agentforce`/`sf-ai-agentscript` (agent authoring), and `sf-deploy`/`sf-data` for execution.
- `sf-afcc-ivr-flow` is **hybrid** (Quick Start patterns in SKILL.md + full DTMF/SSML/voice-profile reference in reference.md).
- When developing the Agentforce agent's planner, topics, and actions, always ground the design in the official GenAI API references: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/einstein/genai/references/about/about-genai-api.html
- Grounded in official Salesforce Help (Add IVR, Manage Media, Set DTMF, Voice Control Options, Languages & Voice Profiles) and the AFCC Salesforce Voice SDO Setup Guide.
